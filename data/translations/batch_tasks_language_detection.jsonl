The Indian Ocean tsunami hit the remote Andaman and Nicobar archipelago badly, killing more than 3,500 people and displacing nearly 40,000 when it slammed into the scenic isles which are about 1,200 km (750 miles) east of the Indian mainland. Sialkot District, about 120km northeast of Lahore, saw torrential rain on 6 August: Drains almost immediately overflowed, villages were inundated, agricultural land damaged and residents left stranded as water surrounded homes. It is forecasted to move west by north at speed of 20-25 km per hour to approach to the coastal areas between Zhuhai to Xuwen with gaining intensity. An early damage estimate from Typhoon Ketsana of more than 30,000 hectares of rice paddy and crops could be double, or even triple, as flood waters continue to rise. Severe winds uprooted trees and smashed windows while heavy rains triggered multiple landslides. A massive earthquake registering 9.0 on the Richter scale struck last Sunday just 60 kilometers from the coast of Indonesia's Aceh province on the northern tip of Sumatra island sending waves of up to 15 meters roaring over its coastline and ricocheting through the Indian Ocean. SurfAid is in process of getting at least 20 trauma counsellors. Some 943 people have been declared dead in this tropical paradise but relief workers believe the death toll could eventually hit more than 10,000.
