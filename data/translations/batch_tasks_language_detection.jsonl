Media Contact Francine Uenuma 202.450.9153 WASHINGTON, D.C.(November 9, 2013)  -  After pummeling the Philippines on Friday, Typhoon Haiyan is expected to pack winds of up to 125 miles per hour as it makes landfall in Vietnam tomorrow morning local time. In the past 24 hours, intense and persistent rainfall was recorded in the northern region of Mozambique, Zambia, Malawi and Tanzania. Heavy monsoon rain at the end of June unleashed mudslides and flash floods in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand which affected 1,600 villages, leaving more than 500 people dead and 5,000 missing. Last year, torrential rains triggered landslides in Bududa district, killing 300 people and forcing thousands to abandon their homes in the mountainous villages of Nametsi, Kubehwo and Namangasa. On our left side was a deep valley and on the right side was highly unstable terrain, with the constant sound of falling rocks. People in Khait Singh's village hold weather changes responsible for the drought and the deaths of their cattle, he tells us. ZHOUQU, Gansu, Sept. 2 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from the massive mudslide in Zhouqu County, in northwest China's Gansu Province, has risen to 1,471 as of Wednesday after four more bodies were retrieved, with 294 others still missing, rescue headquarters said Thursday. This beautiful mountainous landscape is the scene of a real humanitarian disaster, and if the rains continue, it is hard to predict what may happen. Banks, schools, offices shut Elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean, temperatures plunged and heavy snow fell at higher elevations, including in Jerusalem where schools were closed. Officials said the floods -- triggered by unusually heavy monsoon season rains in Orissa and neighboring, upstream states -- had washed away 4,000 houses and damaged 18,000 homes in the same low-lying area that was savaged by a cyclone two years ago. Since western Afghanistan has been profoundly drought affected, recovery assistance will be essential to prevent increased dependence and further pauperisation. It took place almost every hour,\" he said, adding that the strongest tremor they felt measured 6.0 on the Richter scale at the second night they stayed in Hongbai town."}]}}
